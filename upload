# Description:
#
# Somewhat automate the handling of aur packages where you control the
# source files.
#
# How it works:
#
# Place a file in some known directory* for each package you manage, name
# this file the name of the package.
#
# That file will be sourced by this script if that package is passed as
# an argument. The sourcing should define one variable and two
# functions:
#
#   package_files    : the path to the directory that will ultimately be
#                      tarred and uploaded to the AUR.
#
#   pre_edit_hook()  : this function will be called before the PKGBUILD
#                      is presented for editing. Some useful things it
#                      might do are update source files and md5sums.
#
#   post_edit_hook() : this function will be called after the PKGBUILD
#                      has been edited, but before the files are tarred
#                      and uploaded. Some useful things it might do are
#                      remove ./{pkg,src} files created during the
#                      md5sum update or a test packaging run.
#
# When defining the functions, you can use display(), warn(), and
# errorout() as needed. Your functions should return 1 for failure and 0
# for success.
#
# At this time, you can assume that the pre and post hooks will be run
# from within the same directory as the PKGBUILD.
#
# Most errors just result in ending the processing of this argument.
# Commands that fail should report their own errors.
#
# *The "known directory" is defaulted in-script for my usage, it can be
# changed at runtime using the -b or --build_files options
#
